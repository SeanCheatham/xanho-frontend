        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Xanho's mission is to support, augment, and improve academia by providing the best content across a wide variety of intelligently selected courses using a seamlessly integrated research project methodology.</p>
        <p>Other missions include: increasing teacher income, discovering optimal learning patterns, and instilling fun in the learning process</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>Xanho aims to address several of the issues plaguing the American education system.  Amongst these goals are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasise exploration and dream-chasing</li>
          <li>Provide tailored and optimal course content to the individual rather than a generic curriculum to the masses</li>
          <li>Encourage independent and self-driven research while providing a platform for peer collaboration</li>
          <li>Eliminate caps or limits on education; learning is a lifelong process, which should be reflected in our education system</li>
          <li>Unleash creative freedom and exploration through Research Projects</li>
          <li>Eliminate tests, quizzes, exams, and homework</li>
        </ul>
