          <p>Using state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms, the course selection
            evolves over time. &nbsp;New and exciting courses are introduced constantly,
            while old, out-dated ones are archived. &nbsp;There are no degrees or majors;
            you simply pick and choose the topics you find interesting.
            <br>
            <br>Additionally, you can specify a list of life dreams indicating your interests,
            career choices, and hobbies. &nbsp;Using these dreams, Xanho can recommend
            course trajectories which help you achieve these dreams.</p>

        <xanho-home-info-row title="More Learning, Less Memorizing" subtitle="And No Homework"
                             imageurl="https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1423683249427-8ca22bd873e0?w=1024&q=50&fm=jpg&s=5e57c661d0f772ce269188a6f5325708">
          <p>Xanho is research focused, meaning there are no tests, quizzes, or exams.
            &nbsp;As you learn about a topic, you create projects which demonstrate
            understanding of a concept. &nbsp;There is no curriculum. &nbsp;There are
            no deadlines.
            <br>
            <br>Standardized tests detract from learning. &nbsp;Educators have no choice
            but to "teach to the test", and students are forced to memorize and regurgitate
            trivia. &nbsp;The current education system emphasizes evaluation and leaves
            no room for learning.
            <br>
            <br>Any fact can be looked up and confirmed within seconds using today's technology.
            &nbsp;If we, as a species, want to compete with machines, we need to play
            to our strengths. &nbsp;Computers will always be better at memorizing,
            but humans will always be better at creative thinking.</p>

        <xanho-home-info-row title="Point Driven" subtitle="No More Grades, Ranks, Years, or Levels"
                             imageurl="https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1414490929659-9a12b7e31907?w=1024&q=50&fm=jpg&s=f838066e7aa9eab9d1ccc28fd5ec9574">
          <p>Research Projects are scored by qualified educators in the given course.
            &nbsp;Educators are certified to evaluate certain ranges of scores. &nbsp;For
            example, a college professor would be certified on a different range than
            an elementary school teacher.
            <br>
            <br>As you complete Research Projects, multiple educators score them. &nbsp;Your
            score in a given Course is the cumulative sum of your average Research
            Project scores.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>Research Projects are evaluated by their accuracy, originality, and complexity.
            &nbsp;Negative scores can be given for inaccurate information.</p>

        <xanho-home-info-row title="Inexpensive" subtitle="Education Shouldn't Be Held For Ransom"
                             imageurl="https://unsplash.imgix.net/photo-1418479631014-8cbf89db3431?w=1024&q=50&fm=jpg&s=478a9a2196033db7c0bf3c8ba3707f4d">
          <p>The current education system, especially higher education, is extremely
            bloated and unnecessarily expensive. &nbsp;Xanho cuts out the unnecessary
            overheard, and focuses its expenses on the platform and the educators.
            &nbsp;As a result, students pay less, and teachers earn more.
            <br>
            <br>Education should be accessible to anyone, anywhere. &nbsp;Wealth or income
            should not dictate a person's academic potential. &nbsp;Education should
            be fun and affordable rather than a stressful financial decision.
            <br>
            <br>Furthermore, through a peer review process, you can use your own knowledge
            and expertise to evaluate others' projects for credit in the system. &nbsp;In
            theory, you could use Xanho completely free as a student.</p>

        <xanho-home-info-row title="Endless Education" subtitle="Learning Shouldn't Stop at Graduation"

          <p>Life is often divided into two halves: education followed by a career.
            &nbsp;The two should not be mutually exclusive. &nbsp;Education should
            start early and never stop. &nbsp;It's never too late to learn, and your
            future should not be determined by a degree you received decades ago. &nbsp;Stay
            relevant in a changing world. &nbsp;Pick up a new skill. &nbsp;Train for
            a new job. &nbsp;Never stop learning.</p>

          <p>Using our interconnected course model combined with the research point
            system, guage yourself in a world of possible courses to determine your
            strengths and weaknesses. &nbsp;Perhaps you need to brush-up on your math
            skills, or maybe it's time you practiced those writing skills. &nbsp;Using
            a visual map of your educational progress, you can see exactly where you
            stand.
            <br>
            <br>Optionally, you can release your report card and all of your research
            projects to potential employers. &nbsp;The job application process is drastically
            simplified by allowing employers to specify the exact qualifications for
            a position, and students are matched with their dream jobs automatically.</p>

        <xanho-home-info-row title="Tailored Content" subtitle="Individuals Learn Differently"
                             imageurl="https://ununsplash.imgix.net/photo-1423753623104-718aaace6772?w=1024&amp;q=50&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=1ffa61419561b5c796bca3158e7c704c">
          <p>A primary issue with the current education system is that educators need
            to teach to the group rather than the individual. &nbsp;Some students learn
            best through reading, some with images, some with videos, some with physical
            construction, etc. &nbsp;Some educators are better at teaching through
            documents, some through slideshows, some through one-on-one meetings, and
            some just prefer grading projects.
            <br>
            <br>Educators can share their course materials to a much wider audience. &nbsp;Students
            can filter on the content from which they will learn best as well as rate
            the content on its effectiveness.
            <br>
            <br>In the end, students have access to the best course content from a wide
            range of educators covering multiple learning styles.</p>
